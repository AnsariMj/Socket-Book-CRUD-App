Get Book, Update Book and Delete Book which uses Socket.io

Socket.io is like a real-time messenger between a website's server and our web browser. It allows
instant communication, so when we add, update, or delete a book in the app, everyone using the app 
sees the changes right away, without needing to refresh the page. It's like everyone is instantly 
notified of any updates, making the app more interactive and user-friendly.
